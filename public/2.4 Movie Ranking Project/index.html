<h3>Extraction II</h3>
<p>Action packed movie, great main character and story-line</p>

<h3>Avater: The Way of The Water</h3>
<p>Awesome graphics and story-line. A bit occultic though but thrilling too</p>

<h3>Attack on Titan</h3>
<p>Not a movie but a great anime. Let's you see things from different perspective. Highly recommend</p>
